# Cannabis E-Commerce Hybrid Recommendation System

This notebook explores user-product interaction data in a cannabis e-commerce setting (clicks, carts, saves, and purchases) and builds a **hybrid recommender system** combining:
- **Graph embeddings (Node2Vec)** to capture co-engagement patterns  
- **TF-IDF embeddings** on product text for semantic similarity  

I also developed **purchase propensity models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) with SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning to understand buying behavior.

**Key Sections:**
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering (engagement, content, time)  
4. NLP for product similarity  
5. Graph-based embeddings  
6. Hybrid recommendation system design  
7. Model evaluation and insights

The final outcome is a **personalization framework tailored for cannabis marketplaces** like Weedmaps to enhance user experience and product discovery.
